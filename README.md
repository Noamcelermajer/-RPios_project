# Raspberry Pi 3 Bare Metal OS

This project is a bare metal operating system for the Raspberry Pi 3, written in AArch64 assembly and C. It is designed to be a learning tool for understanding operating system fundamentals and Raspberry Pi hardware specifics. The operating system implements a basic shell, using the mailbox interface to communicate with the VideoCore GPU for output. 

## Features

- **Bare Metal Booting and Initial Setup:** The system boots up in AArch64 assembly, with a detailed boot sequence responsible for setting up the environment, including setting up the stack and transitioning from EL3 to EL2.

- **Exception Handling:** The boot code includes handlers for synchronous exceptions, IRQs, FIQs, and system errors. This enables the OS to react and handle different kinds of hardware and software exceptions.

- **Mailbox Interface for GPU Communication:** The mailbox interface is used to communicate with the VideoCore GPU. It allows the OS to set display properties and handle output functionalities.

- **Memory Management:** The OS includes basic memory management features. The `bss` section of memory, which is used for uninitialized global variables, is zeroed out during boot. This is a common practice in OS development to avoid undefined behavior.

- **Basic Shell:** The OS includes a basic shell which provides a simple command interface. This shell leverages the mailbox interface to send output to the GPU.

- **File System Support:** The OS includes support for the FAT file system (`fat.c`), a widely used file system for removable storage devices. This allows the OS to read and write files from SD cards, USB drives, etc.

- **Custom Linker Script:** A custom linker script is used to control the memory layout of the code, specifying where each section of the code should be loaded in memory.

- **QEMU Emulation Support:** The system can be tested locally using QEMU, a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer, which provides a convenient development and testing environment.


## Project File Structure
Based on the file structure you provided, here is an overview:

- **OsDev**: This is the root directory of the project. It contains all the source files, header files, build files, the Makefile, and the final OS image. 

    - **src**: This directory contains all the source code files (.c and .S files). These files are compiled to create the OS.
        - `boot.S`: Assembly code for system bootstrap.
        - `kernel.c`: Main kernel code.
        - `mm.S`: Assembly code for memory management.
        - `utils.S`: Assembly utility functions.
        - Other `.c` files: These implement various functionalities, such as delays, FAT filesystem operations, framebuffer handling, mailbox communication, memory operations, UART, power management, printing, SD card operations, shell, standard library functions, and string operations.
        - `linker.ld`: Linker script to control the memory layout of the final OS image.
        - `font.psf`: Contains a font used by the OS.
    
    - **include**: This directory contains all the header files (.h files) used in the project. They provide function prototypes and macros for the source files.
        - `arm`: Contains headers specific to the ARM architecture.
        - `peripherals`: Contains headers for managing peripheral devices.
        - Other `.h` files: These correspond to the .c files in the src directory, providing their function prototypes and macros.
    
    - **build**: This directory contains the intermediate and final build files. 
        - `.o` files: Object files generated from the .c or .S files.
        - `.d` files: Dependency files generated by the compiler.
        - `kernel8.elf`: The linked file that results from linking all the object files.
        - `kernel8.img`: The final OS image that can be loaded onto a Raspberry Pi.
    
    - **Makefile**: A script used by the `make` build automation tool. It describes the dependencies among the source files and the steps to compile and link them to produce the final OS image, `kernel8.img`.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this operating system, you will need:

- A Raspberry Pi 3
- A GCC cross-compiler for AArch64
- QEMU with support for the `raspi3` machine type

## Building

You can build the project using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
```

This command generates a `kernel8.img` file that can be loaded by the Raspberry Pi bootloader.

## Running

To run the operating system on the Raspberry Pi:

1. Copy the `kernel8.img` file to a SD card.
2. Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi.
3. Power on the Raspberry Pi.

To run the operating system in QEMU you can use makefile:

```bash
make run
```

## Code Overview (In Progress)

- The `boot.S` file contains the assembly code for booting up the system and transitioning from EL3 to EL2.

- The `mBox.c` and `mBox.h` files implement the mailbox interface used to communicate with the GPU.

- The `printf` function and basic shell functionality are implemented in the `shell.c` and `shell.h` files. The shell provides a simple command interface, and uses the mailbox interface to send output to the GPU.

- The `linker.ld` script specifies the memory layout of the code.
